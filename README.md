# SEF Academy – Web Development Tasks

Welcome to my Web Development tasks repository from the **SEF Academy** training program.  
This repo includes all the tasks I completed during the course, covering a wide range of front-end development topics.

Each task is organized in its own folder and contains:
- HTML , CSS and js code
- A dedicated `README.md` file that describes the task’s purpose, technologies used, objectives, and notes
- live previews for better understanding
