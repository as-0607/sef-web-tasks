# Task 02 – Practicing HTML Structure & CSS Spacing

## 📝 Description
This task is part of my SEF Academy Web Development training.  
It focuses on practicing basic HTML structure and applying CSS spacing using `margin` and `padding` properties.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice writing standard HTML elements (e.g., `div`, `h1`, `p`, `img`, `a`)
- Understand and apply CSS spacing techniques:
  - `margin` to control spacing outside elements
  - `padding` to control spacing inside elements
- Use external CSS for cleaner code

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: main structure of the page
- `style.css`: contains styling and spacing rules

## 📌 Notes
- This task helped me understand the CSS Box Model more clearly.
- I practiced using different spacing values to improve layout design and content alignment.
