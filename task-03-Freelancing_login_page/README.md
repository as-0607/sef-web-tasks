# Task 03 – Freelancing Login Page with Background Image

## 📝 Description
In this task, I designed a simple freelancing-style login page using HTML and CSS.  
The main focus was to practice working with `background-image` and related CSS properties.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Use `background-image` to create visually appealing page backgrounds
- Apply background-related CSS properties:
  - `background-size`
  - `background-repeat`
  - `background-position`
  - `background-attachment`
- Style inputs and buttons to match a clean login design

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: page structure and form
- `style.css`: styling and background image setup

## 📌 Notes
- This task improved my understanding of how to control background images effectively in web design.
- I also practiced aligning and spacing elements in a real-world style login page.
