# Task 04 – Price Cards with CSS Hover Effects

## 📝 Description
This task focuses on building pricing cards using HTML and CSS.  
The main goal was to practice layout design and interactive hover effects to enhance user experience.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create clean and structured price card layouts using `div`s
- Use CSS to style elements like titles, prices, and buttons
- Implement `:hover` effects on cards and buttons to add interactivity:
  - Change background color
  - Smooth transitions

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: contains the structure of the price cards
- `style.css`: includes all styling and hover effects

## 📌 Notes
- I practiced to create smooth hover animations.
- This task helped me understand how to design component-based layouts using only HTML and CSS.
