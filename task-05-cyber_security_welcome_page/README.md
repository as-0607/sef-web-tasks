# Task 05 – Cyber Security Welcome Page with Embedded YouTube Videos

## 📝 Description
In this task, I designed a welcome page for a Cyber Security topic using HTML and CSS.  
The main feature of this task is embedding YouTube videos directly into the webpage to provide educational content.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a structured and welcoming layout using HTML elements
- Use the `<iframe>` tag to embed YouTube videos responsively
- Apply basic CSS styling to align content and create a clean visual hierarchy
- Organize sections like: welcome message, topic introduction, and video section

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: structure of the page with embedded videos
- `style.css`: page styling (colors, layout, fonts)

## 📌 Notes
- I practiced how to integrate third-party content (YouTube) directly into webpages.
- This task also helped me improve page layout and content organization.
