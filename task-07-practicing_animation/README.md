# Task 07 – Practicing CSS Animations

## 📝 Description
This task focuses on learning and applying CSS animations to enhance the visual behavior of webpage elements.  
The goal was to create movement, transitions, or visual effects using `@keyframes` and animation properties.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Use the `@keyframes` rule to define custom animations
- Apply `animation-name`, `duration`, `timing-function`, `iteration-count`, and other properties

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- CSS3 (animations, keyframes, transitions)

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: contains the HTML structure of animated elements
- `style.css`: includes all animation styles and keyframes

## 📌 Notes
- I learned how to create smooth and engaging visual effects using only CSS.
- This task helped me understand how to control animation timing, delay, and iteration.
