# Task 11 – Practicing Layout with Bootstrap

## 📝 Description
In this task, I started using the Bootstrap framework to create responsive and mobile-friendly layouts.  
The goal was to practice using Bootstrap’s grid system, utility classes, and pre-styled components to build a well-structured page.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up a Bootstrap project using the CDN link
- Use the 12-column grid system for layout
- Apply Bootstrap classes for:
  - Spacing (`p-`, `m-`, `gap-`)
  - Responsive columns (`col-md-6`, `col-lg-4`, etc.)
  - Typography and buttons
  - Containers and rows
- Build a responsive design with minimal custom CSS

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (basic)
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com)

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: contains Bootstrap-based structure and components
- `style.css`: contains minimal custom styling if needed

## 📌 Notes
- This task helped me understand how to use Bootstrap’s classes to build responsive layouts faster.
- I practiced applying rows, columns, and responsive breakpoints without writing complex CSS.
