# Task 12 – Add to Cart with Total Price (First JavaScript Project)

## 📝 Description
This task is my first hands-on project using JavaScript.  
The goal was to build a basic "Add to Cart" functionality where clicking on products adds them to a list, and a button displays the total price of all selected products.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Add event listeners to product buttons
- Dynamically insert selected products into a `<div>`
- Store product prices and calculate the total on button click
- Display the total price on the page

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- HTML5 (page layout)
- CSS3 (basic styling)
- JavaScript (core logic and interaction)

## 📁 Files
- `index.html`: structure of the product list and cart area
- `style.css`: styling for layout and buttons
- `script.js`: handles add-to-cart logic and total price calculation

## 📌 Notes
- I practiced working with:
  - `document.querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`
  - `addEventListener`
  - `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and element creation
- This task introduced me to how JavaScript makes pages interactive and dynamic.
